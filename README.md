Created By: Jacob Cecil

This project was assigned as Project 1 by Dr. Gestwicki for CS 315 Game Programming at Ball State University during the Fall 2021 semester. 

## Instructions:
Goal: Get the ball to the flag.

Hold Space bar to build power, and let go to launch.

Up arrow - Increase angle of launch

Down arrow - Decrease angle of launch

## Project Report
### Iteration 3
I'm still tring to get my work school life in order, so this entire project has been rough.
 I spent the bulk of my time for this iteration trying to instance my projectile. 
 In the end, I ended up basing my level script off of the Demo provided by Dr. Gestwicki. 
 After making that decision, I was able to move onto other areas that where in need of polishing. 
 For the final iteration, I finally got arount to adding in fonts (or, I guess a font). 
 I chose Grechen Fuemen from Google Fonts.
 To me, something about this particular font seemed to just fit in the with rest of the art of the game. 
 Iteration 3 also brought to life the title screen. 
 I wasn't able to get around to adding in animations, which is the main reason I'm not aiming for the highest grade.
