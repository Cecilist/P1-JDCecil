# Project 1: Un-named 2D Physics-Based Game
Created By: Jacob Cecil

This project was assigned as Project 1 by Dr. Gestwicki for CS 315 Game Programming at Ball State University during the Fall 2021 semester. 

## Instructions:
Space bar - Launch ball

Up arrow - Increase angle of launch

Down arrow - Decrease angle of launch

## Project Report
### Iteration 1: 
I was really excited to start this project! Looking ahead to what the final iteration is supposed to look like, I can see this project quickly becoming the kind of game I would play on some flash game site instead of paying attention in high school. Most of the necessary tools were demonstrated to us in class, so this first iteration wasn't to challenging. The only thing I had to figure out to meet all of the B requirements was clamping, which with Godot's built in clamp method, was eay to understand. The A requirements look to be where the real challenege lies. 

Self Evaluation: 

I beleive I have met all requirents for an B
- [x] D-1: The repository link is submitted to Canvas before the project deadline.
- [x] D-2: The repository contains a <code>README.md</code> file in its top-level directory.

- [x] C-1: Your repository is well-formed, with an appropriate <code>.gitignore</code> file and no unnecessary files tracked.
- [x] C-2: Your release is tagged using <a href="https://semver.org/">semantic versioning</a> where the major version is zero, the minor version is the iteration number, and the patch version is incremented as usual for each change made to the minor version, and the release name matches the release tag.
- [x] C-3: You have a clear legal right to use all incorporated assets, and the licenses for all third-party assets are tracked in the <code>README.md</code> file.
- [x] C-4: The <code>README.md</code> contains instructions for how to play the game or such instructions are incorporated into the game itself.
- [x] C-5: The project content is eligible for an <a href="https://www.esrb.org/ratings-guide/">ESRB Rating</a> of T or less.
- [x] C-6: The player can control the angle at which the projectile is fired.
- [x] C-7: The player can fire the projectile.
- [x] C-8: The projectile's flight is affected by gravity using Godot Engine's physics system.
- [x] C-9: There is a &ldquo;ground&rdquo; that stops the projectile.
- [x] C-10: There is a non-ground target that the projectile can hit.
- [x] B-1: The <code>README.md</code> file contains a personal reflection on the iteration and self-evaluation, as defined above.
- [x] B-2: The projectile's firing angle is clamped between 0&deg; (straight forward) and 90&deg; (straight up).
- [ ] A-1: The player can modify the strength of the projectile's firing.
- [ ] A-2: There is a visual indicator showing the angle at which the projectile will fire.
- [ ] A-3: The projectile's hitting the target is recognized and logged to the console or otherwise indicated.
